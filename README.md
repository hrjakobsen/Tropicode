The goal of this project is to provide a tool for analyzing object protocol (typestates) for
languages targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# The tool

The project is very early in its development, and as of now don't support nearly enough of the JVM
instructions to be used for practical programs. With that said however, there exists enough
functionality to showcase the usefulness of the tool.

Consider the following class definition:

```java
package simplecall;

import Annotations.Protocol;

@Protocol("{setFirstName; {setLastName; {greet; end}}  setLastName; {setFirstName; {greet; end}}}")
public class Person {

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName);
    }
}
```

The `@Protocol` annotation specifies that the protocol of the `Person` class is to either
call `setFirstName` or `setLastName` followed by the other operation (`setFirstName` if you started
with `setLastName` etc.). After setting both names, the `greet`
method can be called, and the protocol is finished.

Now let's look at how the class may be used in a program:

```java
package simplecall;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person();
        p.setFirstName("John");
        p.greet();
    }
}
```

In the code above, we have forgot to call the `setLastName` method before greeting the person. The
tool catches the error, and prints the following error:

```
================================================================================
              Checker.Exceptions.InvalidProtocolOperationException              
Invalid operation 'greet' for protocol {setLastName; {greet; end}}. The availabl
e operations are: {setLastName}
================================================================================
```

All analysis is performed statically (without executing the program), and hence will not incur a
runtime overhead, and will catch protocol errors before the program is deployed.

# Is this a Java tool?

Yes and no. The checker itself performs all analysis on the Java bytecode (the compiled code for the
JVM). This means that the tool will work for Java code, but also for other languages that compiles
to Java bytecode such as Scala, Kotlin or Clojure. Be aware though, that the protocol
specifications _are_ language specific and must relate to the compiled
`.class` files, and not necessarily the classes defined in the program text.

For Java this is pretty straightforward, as classes generated classes matches closely the ones
defined in the program text, for other languages this may not be the case. The `@Protocol`
annotation is currently provided by the tool for use in Java programs. In the future this will
expanded to other languages as well.

# Todo

* Add choice typestates
    * Requires parsing of enum classes along with analysis of the static jump-arrays in other
      classes
* Implement rest of bytecode operations
    * 197 / 204 implemented
* Track objects in:
    * Parameters
* Handle arrays
    * On AASTORE, we should lose track of the object
    * On AALOAD how do we handle calls on the returned objects?
